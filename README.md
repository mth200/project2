#project2

I apologize if I did not transfer the files correctly from the terminal to GitHub. I was a little confused and I am not sure if I did it correctly. If you see any problems please let me know so I can fix these before project 3 so I can be prepared, thank you!

The biggest problem that I have been facing was through my backup.sh file. For some odd reason, I can't find the right directory to attach it to. Even though my code words perfectly, I have this one issue that needs to be resolved. I also had a few problems when transferring my code over to github, so I'm not exactly sure if I completed this task correctly as well. I know that it should have been easy for me to do, but for some reason I was having more trouble than usual.


Steps 1-8 were very simple and easy to follow along with, as it mostly showed basic steps on how we were to complete the steps 9-17 due to how they got more and more complicated. 

Step 9 is where I started having problems with the backup.sh but of course, that is something that can be fixed quickly when I find the right directory to use. This problem continued through all the other steps until the end, but I will be trying to correct this issue in time for project 3 so I will be able to focus on the new work.

Step 17 was very simpliest and made it easier to remember how to use nano since that was the basis of this step. It was mainly repetative work with creating the loop files and that helped with getting used to these new commands.


As of now, it is working *almost* correctly for me, so I hope it works well for others, too.
